# NoName Anonymous Surveys

**NoName Anonymous Surveys** is an open-source platform designed for conducting truly anonymous surveys. Using linkable ring signature technology, it ensures that:

#### - ‚úÖ Responses are verifiable as being from members of a designated group.
#### - ‚úÖ Respondent identities remain entirely anonymous.
#### - ‚úÖ Each user can respond only once to a survey.

You are free to use, modify, and host your own instance of the platform. Setup instructions and tips are provided below.

## üéØ Key Features
1. **Anonymity**: Identity protection through cryptographic techniques.
2. **Group-Specific Access**: Surveys can be restricted to specific groups or open to the public.
3. **User-Friendly**: Easy setup and usage for both users and administrators.

- **Python**
- **Poetry**
- **Make**
- **Docker** (optional)
- **Kubernetes** (optional)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Environment Variables**
You need to set up the required environment variables in the `.env` files in the frontend and backend directories.
#### Frontend:
```bash
  AUTH_USOS_ID="<usos_consumer_key>" # used for usos oauth1.0a authentication
  AUTH_USOS_SECRET="<usos_consumer_secret>" # used for usos oauth1.0a authentication
  AUTH_USOS_BASE_URL="<usosapi_base_url>" # used for usos oauth1.0a authentication
  BACKEND_HOST="http://backend:8000" # change it if docker is not used
  ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000" # change it if docker is not used
  BEARER_TOKEN="<random_string>" # used for frontend authentication
```

#### Backend:
```bash
  SETTINGS_db_type="" # database type (postgresql)
  SETTINGS_db_dialect="" # can be left empty
  SETTINGS_db_user="" # database username
  SETTINGS_db_password="" # database password
  SETTINGS_db_host="" # database server address
  SETTINGS_db_port="" # database server port
  SETTINGS_db_name="" # database name
  SETTINGS_bearer_token="<same_random_string_as_in_frontend>" # used for frontend authentication
```

#### Kubernetes:
If you want to deploy the app on a Kubernetes cluster, you have to add secrets for the environment variables. You can do it by running the following commands:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic frontend --from-env-file=./frontend/.env
kubectl create secret generic backend --from-env-file=./backend/.env
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Setup**
You can deploy the app using Docker images or build it locally.

#### Using Prebuilt Docker Images: [frontend](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sjerzykiewicz/noname-surveys-frontend) & [backend](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sjerzykiewicz/noname-surveys-backend):
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Building Locally:
```bash
docker compose -f "docker-compose.local.yml" up --build
```

#### Run Locally (without Docker):
Frontend and Backend have separate setup instructions. Refer to the respective README files for detailed steps. Here's a quick overview:
- Frontend: `npm install` & `npm run dev`
- Backend: `make install_dev` & `make run`

#### Kubernetes:
You can deploy the app on a Kubernetes cluster using the provided configuration files. You need to have `kubectl` installed and configured to use the cluster. You can change images tags in *-deployment.yaml files. Run the following command to deploy the app:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
