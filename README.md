# üîê NoName Anonymous Surveys

**NoName Anonymous Surveys** is an open-source platform designed for conducting truly anonymous surveys. Using linkable ring signature technology, it ensures that:

#### - ‚úÖ Responses are verifiable as being from members of a designated group.
#### - ‚úÖ Respondent identities remain entirely anonymous.
#### - ‚úÖ Each user can respond only once to a survey.

You are free to use, modify, and host your own instance of the platform. Setup instructions and tips are provided below.

---

## üöÄ Example Use Case

### Check out the example instance for the **University of Adam Mickiewicz** [here](https://nonamesurveys.projektstudencki.pl/).
> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that this instance can be accessed only by students and staff of the university.

## ü§î Explanations

### **Linkable Ring Signature**
- **Linkable Ring Signature** is a cryptographic protocol that allows specifying groups of possible signers. When submiting answer to a secure survey, you generate a signature which is then verified by the server.
- **How does the server know I am a member of the group?** - The group of respondents is determined by the set of public keys of its members. The signature generated by you contains a zero knowledge proof of your knowledge
of a private key corresponding to some public key in this group. This allows the server to verify that you know this key, but its value remains secret.
- **How does the server know I have already answered the survey?** - During signature generation, you compute a special value using the entire set of public keys and your private key. For a given group, this value will always be
the same for the same user. However, it is mathematically infeasible to recover the private key used to compute this value, so you remain anonymous.

## üìö Additional Information

### üßÖ If you want to be extra careful, and wish to enhance your anonymity further, we recommend using the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/) browser. Tor routes your internet traffic through a network of servers, encrypting it multiple times and masking your IP address to obscure your location and activity. This ensures that platform administrators, as well as other parties, cannot trace your actions back to your device or monitor your browsing activity effectively.


### ‚ùì **Question Types**
- **Text** - allows the respondent to enter a free-form text response.
- **Number** - allows the respondent to enter a numerical response.
- **Single** - allows the respondent to select one option from a list of choices.
- **Multi** - allows the respondent to select multiple options from a list of choices.
- **Binary** - allows the respondent to select one of two options (e.g., yes/no).
- **Scale** - allows the respondent to select a value from a range (e.g., 1-5).
- **Slider** - allows the respondent to select a value by moving a slider.
- **List** - allows the respondent to select one option from a list of choices (e.g., dropdown).
- **Rank** - allows the respondent to rank a list of choices in order of preference.

### üåê Sharing the Website
- You can share a QR code by clicking on the **Invite** button at the bottom of the page after going to the **Account** section.
- You can also share the website with others by providing them with the link: [https://nonamesurveys.projektstudencki.pl/](https://nonamesurveys.projektstudencki.pl/)

### üîë AMU USOS Authentication
- The platform uses the AMU USOS API for authentication.
- You need to have an AMU USOS account to log in to the platform.
- If you are a student or a staff member of the University of Adam Mickiewicz, you can log in using your AMU USOS credentials.
- It makes it easier both for us and for you to verify your identity.

### üëÅÔ∏è Accessibility
- We strive to make the platform accessible to everyone.
- If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know.
- You can use the **High Contrast** mode by clicking on the **High Contrast** in numerous places on the website.

### üåö Dark and üåû Light Mode
- You can switch between **Dark** and **Light** mode by clicking on the **Dark Mode** or **Light Mode** button in the navigation bar.
- We have very strong feelings about the superiority of each mode, so we encourage you to try both and see which one you prefer.

### üåç Languages Supported
- The platform is currently available in 2 languages:
  - üá¨üáßü´ò **English**
  - üáµüá±ü•ü **Polish**
- You can switch between them by clicking on **Polish** or **Angielski** similarly to the **Dark** and **Light** mode.

## üõ† Administrator's Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ üñáÔ∏è **Dependencies**
- **Node.js (npm)**
- **Python**
- **Poetry**
- **Make**
- **Docker** (optional)
- **Kubernetes** (optional)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ü§ù **Environment Variables**
You need to set up the required environment variables in the `.env` files in the frontend and backend directories.
#### Frontend:
```bash
  AUTH_USOS_ID="<usos_consumer_key>" # used for usos oauth1.0a authentication
  AUTH_USOS_SECRET="<usos_consumer_secret>" # used for usos oauth1.0a authentication
  AUTH_USOS_BASE_URL="<usosapi_base_url>" # used for usos oauth1.0a authentication
  BACKEND_HOST="http://backend:8000" # change it if docker is not used
  ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000" # change it if docker is not used
  BEARER_TOKEN="<random_string>" # used for frontend authentication
```

#### Backend:
```bash
  SETTINGS_db_type="" # database type (postgresql)
  SETTINGS_db_dialect="" # can be left empty
  SETTINGS_db_user="" # database username
  SETTINGS_db_password="" # database password
  SETTINGS_db_host="" # database server address
  SETTINGS_db_port="" # database server port
  SETTINGS_db_name="" # database name
  SETTINGS_bearer_token="<same_random_string_as_in_frontend>" # used for frontend authentication
```

#### Kubernetes:
If you want to deploy the app on a Kubernetes cluster, you have to add secrets for the environment variables. You can do it by running the following commands:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic frontend --from-env-file=./frontend/.env
kubectl create secret generic backend --from-env-file=./backend/.env
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all environment variables are secrets, so you have to edit env values in the `k8s/*-deployment.yaml` files.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ üê≥ **Setup**
You can deploy the app using Docker images, build it locally or run it on Kubernetes cluster.

#### Using Prebuilt Docker Images: [frontend](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sjerzykiewicz/noname-surveys-frontend) & [backend](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sjerzykiewicz/noname-surveys-backend):
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Building Locally:
```bash
docker compose -f "docker-compose.local.yml" up --build
```

#### Run Locally (without Docker):
Frontend and Backend have separate setup instructions. Refer to the respective README files for detailed steps. Here's a quick overview:
- Frontend: `npm install` & `npm run dev`
- Backend: `make install_dev` & `make run`

#### Kubernetes:
You can deploy the app on a Kubernetes cluster using the provided configuration files. You need to have `kubectl` installed and configured to use the cluster. Run the following command to deploy the app:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
> [!NOTE]
> You can change images tags in `k8s/*-deployment.yaml` files.
